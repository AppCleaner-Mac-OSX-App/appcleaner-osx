## What is AppCleaner?  

**AppCleaner** is a lightweight and reliable **uninstaller tool** that helps you completely remove applications along with all related files, ensuring your system stays organized and free of clutter. It provides an efficient way to delete apps safely — without leaving behind traces that slow down your device over time.  

Unlike basic deletion methods, AppCleaner dives deep into system folders to locate hidden files, caches, logs, and leftover data that are often missed by manual removals. Its simple drag-and-drop interface makes it accessible to anyone, while its scanning engine ensures precision with every cleanup.  

You can view all installed apps, perform batch uninstalls, and even manage associated files directly from a single dashboard. The result is a smoother, faster experience and more free storage space.  

With full **Apple Silicon optimization**, AppCleaner works quietly in the background, consuming minimal resources while delivering thorough cleaning results. It’s an essential tool for users who frequently install, test, or replace software and want to maintain a spotless system.
